Here are the rules and examples in the above URl:

Most words in Pig Latin end in "ay." Use the rules below to translate normal English into Pig Latin.

1. If a word starts with a consonant and a vowel, put the first letter of the word at the end of the word and add "ay."

Example: Happy = appyh + ay = appyhay


2. If a word starts with two consonants move the two consonants to the end of the word and add "ay."

Example: Child = Ildch + ay = Ildchay


3. If a word starts with a vowel add the word "way" at the end of the word.

Example: Awesome = Awesome +way = Awesomeway
